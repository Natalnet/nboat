Talk about both sailboats and the project in general.

We are currently working on 3 different platforms: Nboat I, Nboat II and WQboat I, each used for different purpuses.


Nboat I
=======

Small sailboat used for initial understanding of sailing control, sailboat movement and dynamics. This is an RC Moonsoon sailboat (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/monsoon-sailboat-1800mm-71-almost-ready-to-sail.html) adapted for robotics, where we modified the structure to add a waterproof compartiment and embaked the necessary eletronics for autonomous navigation.
