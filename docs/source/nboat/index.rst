Nboat (Version 2.0)
=========================

After testing some of the methods for sailboat navigation in a reduced model we (and some financial problems) we finally started to build the 2 meters platform we would eventually use in real world applications.

Our ideal was to use the same eletronics, sensors and navigations techinches validated in the smaller platform with little to no changes in this bigger platform.

On its final form, the NBoat 2 should be able to navigate autonomously to desired points in the globe, being robust enough to support harsh environments such as strong winds and high waves, performing long term missions lasting several weeks or months, using solar power to charge its batteries. Thats our goal.

Below, we explain with details some of this journey of build such a complex robotic platform.
