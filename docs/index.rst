About the project
=================

The Nboat Project started in 2013. Our main goal is to develop robots that moves on the surface of the water to be used as an educational tool to increase interest in the area of mobile robotics in our community and in the process develop human resources specialized in environmental and green robotics.

Further, our plataforms will be used to help researchers in applications such as water quality evaluation and coastal survailancy. Our secondary goal is to participate in various autonomous robots competitions such as the Microtransat Challenge, IRSC and WRSC. The Nboat project is partially funded by CNPq and CAPES.
