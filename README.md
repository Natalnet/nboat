# Nboat Project Repository 

This repository contains the ongoing development of the Nboat robots, software and hardware, with the purpose of document our work and facilitate the process of adding new personal. Most of the code here is in C++ (Arduino), and implement navigation, control and sensors and actuators drivers. It is important to keep all code up-to-date and operational.
