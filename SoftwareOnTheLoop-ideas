- embark all the necessary systems on the boats
    - sensors
    - main code on arduino

- use serial communications to test some cases. example:
    - the test begins.
    - waypoints are set
    - we see if the rudder and propeller are working accordingly
    - after some seconds, we say (on the code) to the system that the boat is approaching the target
    - we see if the propeler change its behavior
    - we manually turn the boat side to side and see if the rudder adjusts accordingly
    - after some seconds we say that the boat is even closer to the target
    - we see if the propeler change its behavior
    - we say that the boat reached the target
    - and see if the propeler stops
    - after some seconds we see if the system get the new waypoint and try to go there
