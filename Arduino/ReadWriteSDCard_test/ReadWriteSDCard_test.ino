/*
  SD card read/write

 This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 51
 ** MISO - pin 50
 ** SCK - pin 52
 ** CS - pin 48 (for MKRZero SD: SDCARD_SS_PIN)

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.

  // re-open the file for reading:
  myFile = SD.open("test.txt");

    Serial.println("test.txt:");

    // read from the file until there's nothing else in it:

    }
    // close the file:
    myFile.close();
  } else {
    // if the file didn't open, print an error:
    Serial.println("error opening test.txt");
